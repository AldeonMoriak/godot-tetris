# Tetris Clone with Godot 4

I created this Tetris clone using Godot 4 to explore the capabilities of the engine. While it's a barebone version of the classic Tetris game, it offers a satisfying experience of clearing rows without the pressure of scoring.

## Features:
- Display of the next four pieces.
- Hard drop for quick piece placement.
- Ghost piece to preview the location at the bottom of the grid.
- Reserve piece functionality.
- Super rotation system.

## Controls:
- Joystick
- Keyboard:
  - Arrow keys: Move pieces.
  - Q: Rotate left.
  - R: Rotate right.
  - SPACE: Hard drop.
  - TAB: Reserve the piece.

Feel free to play around with the controls and enjoy the simple pleasure of watching pieces vanish as you complete rows!
